                    Meet  Pattambi's First Female Superhero Who Fights Sexual Violence 
            </h1>
            <p>
                Pattambi's first female comic book superhero, Her-o is an advocate for people who had been victims of sexual abuse.  
                She has seen people be tortured physically, and mentally over and over again whether its in the news or its someone she knows and she wishes that no one goes through the horror she witnessed.
                HER-O is here to save the day of Pattambi and spread awareness about sexual abuse-related issues.
                <br/>
                No good girl walks alone at night that what they say. She realised that rape and sexual violence in Pattambi was a cultural issue, and that it was backed by patriarchy, misogyny and people's perceptions.
