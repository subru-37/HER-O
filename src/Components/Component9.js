                    Meet  Pattambi's First Female Superhero Who Fights Sexual Violence 
            </h1>
            <p>
                Pattambi's first female comic book superhero, Her-o is a rape survivor. 
                She had been tortured physically, and mentally over and over again by her abuser and she wishes that no one goes through the horror she went through. 
                Move over Black Widow or Captian Marvel, Her-o, a salwar-Kameez sporting superhero is here to save the day- and spread awareness about sexual abuse-related issues. Her-o is India's first comic book superhero who was raped at a young age and consequently shamed by her family and community. According to the latest data, more than 32,500 rape cases and 1000 acid attacks cases were registered with the police in 2017. No good girl walks alone at night that what they say. That's where the idea began. She realised that rape and sexual violence in Pattambi was a cultural issue, and that it was backed by patriarchy, misogyny and people's perceptions.
