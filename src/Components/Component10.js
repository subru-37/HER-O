                        Of all the traditional superhero powers, very few are as easily named as flight. What is a superhero without flying abilities? Flight is of prime importance because the her-o needs to reach at the place of action within a fraction of second. Even though itâ€™s not impossible, it is really hard without it.
                        Flight can exponentially unleash the potential that Lies within. Simply put, flight is synonymous with superheroes because flight is something every commoner desires.

                    The longevity of the hero's existence depends on healing. Not only does expedite the time for wounds to repair but it also greatly increases the length of life of a hero. If a body can heal quickly externally, it also means that it heals quickly internally. A superhero who can heal never has to worry about a heart attack, kidney failure, infection, or the like. In addition, due to their power to heal they also age at an infinitesimal rate.
